        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <br>
            As part of my IDC4U project, I interviewed an Assistant Professor from a university in Ontario about their 
            experience in both Machine Leaning industry and academia. Our conversations took place over zoom and I 
            conducted this to dig a little deeper about the subject. For privacy reasons, I won't be stating explicitly
            their name on my portfolio, but I'd be happy to connect any future IDC4U students with them if it happens to be of interest. The 
            key points and my reflection on the experience can be found below 
            <br><br>
            
        </p>
        <h3>Questions Asked</h3>
        <p>
            <br>
            1. What part of being a Machine Learning Engineer requires knowledge that a university can't teach you?   
            <br><br>
            2. Did you partake in any research groups during your time at university and where they more mathematics oriented or computer science?   
            <br><br>
            3. Did you find math to be an everyday part of your career or something you experienced mostly in academia?   
            <br><br>
            4. How do you manage the ethics portion of Machine learning i.e. your career being one that takes advantage of users data without permission  
            <br><br>
            5. What part of your undergraduate experience did you find most impactful to your career  
            <br>

        <h3>Most Surprising thing learned</h3>
        <p>
            <br>
            Reflecting on this interview, the most surprising thing I learned is the emphasis that recruiters put on practical, real-world experiences instead of the 
            theoretical knowledge acquired in university. While academia provides a solid foundation in mathematics and computer science, the application of these prin
            ciples in industry involves navigating messy data, mastering rapidly evolving tools and frameworks, and ensuring scalability and deployment of models. Thus,
             there's often a learning gap between fresh graduates from the field and those who've had internships or experience working.  
            <br>
            Understanding that a significant part of a machine learning engineer's expertise is developed through these applications and extensions of knowledge highlights the 
            importance of practical exposure, internships, and real-world projects. It gave me an idea on how I should roadmap my undergraduate experience if I want to 
            pursue a career in machine learning. Now, instead of focusing on  
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Other things learned</h3>
        <p>
            <br>
            I also learned that pursuing a continued degree in Machine Learning such as a master or Ph.D. didn’t necessarily mean one had to publish papers in their 
            undergraduate year. Although it is an indicator of passion for the subject, a lot of other, more comprehensive, indicators included internships, personal 
            projects and seminars. In fact, hands-on experience through internships and jobs can provide practical skills that are highly valued in the academia, 
            especially as post-grads will enter industry eventually. 
            <br>
            Participating in seminars and conferences can also help in networking with professionals and 
            staying updated with the latest advancements and trends in the field. Working on personal projects or contributing to open-source projects can also 
            show one's initiative and ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.  
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Moving Foreward</h3>
        <p>
            <br>
            Knowing the emphasis on application-based experience in ML, I’ll take a more hands on approach to my project moving forward. Instead of spending all my time 
            learning modules and topics in ML, I want to create something tangible like an object detection system that processes text in real time or an automatic 
            ASL-speech glove translator. This can also help with my physics summative as it’s about creating a working product for social good! 

            I also started gathering some data on my friends and their preferences of movies to create a simple recommendation system, to test my knowledge!  
            <br><br>

        <h3> Closing remarks </h3>
        <p>
            <br>
            The biggest challenge for my interview was scheduling a convenient time that worked for both the expert and myself. As an assistant professor at a university with over 60,000 students, this proved to be difficult as I was living in Appleby schedule time as well. But eventually, a spot opened up on his calendar and we were able to do a zoom call meeting! Another challenge was ensuring my questions were insightful and relevant. I wanted to leave a good impression on my field expert and also show respect for his time to do this interview with me. It would’ve been a shame to spend so much time scheduling just to end up with an underwhelming conversation.  
            <br>
 

Despite these challenges, I really enjoyed this part of my IDC4U project because it gave me the opportunity to connect with someone in my future career. The conversation provided me with deeper understanding on the ML industry and how to prepare my future undergraduate years to maximize my chances of thriving in it!
