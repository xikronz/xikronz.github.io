            <h2>Careers in Mathematics Overview</h2>
            <p>Mathematics has always seemed limitless to me and this project is a reflection of that sentiment. The more you think you 
                understand a concept, the more there is to explore, and the more you realize you want to know. It's as if the subject  
                seems to be constantly unravelling from itself without end! This year, I've dediced to deepen my understanding and application of mathematics 
                by investigating 6 potential careers: Quantative Analyst, Astrobiologist, Robotics Engineer, Game Developper,  
                Cryptographer and Full Stack Web Developper. Throughout the year, I'll be taking a deep dive into 2 of them, Cryptographer and Robotics Engineer, to fully immerse myself into the interdisciplinary world of math!

        <h2>Quantative Analyst</h2>
        <img src="images/quant.png" id="quant">
        <p>A recently emerging career, quantitative analysts (quants for short) work for investment banks, 
            stock brokerages and wealth management firms to perform financial analysis. Their role is pivot
            al in today's finance industry, where they employ advanced mathematical models to analyze financ
            ial markets and assess risk.
            <br><br>
            Quants typically have a strong mathematics, statistics, finance, and computer science background.
             Their expertise lies in creating sophisticated models that predict market trends, price financi\
             al instruments, and develop algorithmic trading strategies. The first-year course load includes c
             alculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and probability theory to model the behaviour o
             f financial markets. 
            <br><br> 
            A typical career progression of a Quant would look as follows: 
            
            <br><br>
            These models are used by traders and portfolio managers for pricing derivatives, managing risk, 
            and optimizing portfolios. Quants also utilize stochastic calculus which is essential in valuing 
            more complex 
            financial products like options and futures. In addition to these mathematical skills, quants must 
            also be proficient in programming 
            languages. C++ is typically used for high-frequency trading applications, and offline statistical 
            analysis would be performed in MATLAB, SAS, S-PLUS or a similar package.

        <h2>Astrobiologist</h2>
        <img src="images/astrobio.png" id="astro">
        <p>At its core, astrobiologists use mathematical modeling to search for the potential 
            of life on other planets by understanding the chemical and physical processes that 
            could lead to the emergence of life, such as the formation of organic molecules. Th
            ese models are often based on differential equations that describe rate processes, th
            ermodynamics, and chemical kinetics.
            <br><br>
            They also play a crucial role in the interpretation of data received from telescopes 
            and space missions. Astrobiologists analyze patterns and anomalies in this data to draw 
            conclusions about planetary environments using topology which they encounter in second/
            third year university. It provides a way to capture the shape of data across different 
            scales by facilitating features extraction (like clusters, loops, or voids). 
            <br><br>
            In their first year of studies, most students take real analysis and abstract algebra 
            for its insights into the symmetry of polynomial equations. Complex analysis is used 
            in wave propagation simulations and fluid dynamics. Topology is subtly used to observe 
            spatial structures, like the shapes of molecules essential to life.

        <h2>Robotics Engineer</h2>
        <img src="images/robot.png" id="astro">
        <p>Robotics engineers are responsible for designing, building, and maintaining integrated robo
            tic systems used everyday from autonomous driving to assembly management. Their focus lies
             in optimizing task efficiency and facilitating human-robot interactions. 
            <br><br>
            The technique used to manipulate joints and precise arm motion calibration is called inverse 
            kinematics, an extension of first year calculus and Euclidean geometry used to solve for the 
            angles required in multi-joint systems. Its essential for enabling robots to interact with 
            their environment in a fluid and natural manner. Control theory is responsible for managing 
            the behavior of dynamic systems to perform the desired task. At a graduate level, students 
            specializes into core modules like computational geometry, which deals with algorithms for 
            path planning, object recognition, and environment mapping.

        <h2>Game Developper</h2>
        <img src="images/pac.png" id="games">
        <p>Behind every blockbuster game, whether it’s modern pvps ike Valorant, Fortnite, CS:GO, or 
            retro classics like pac man and eldin ring, is one core subject game developers rely on: 
            mathematics. Its prevalence has led to industry terms like “shader math”, “queue theory”, 
            “discrete stacks” that focus on user experiences to make games so immersive today. 
            <br><br> 
            In the realm of graphics and rendering, first year university students take linear algebra
             to handle spatial transformations. Eigenvalues are used to create and manipulate 3D enviro
             nments, while matrix operations handle complex transformations that make the game world dy
             namic and immersive. Discrete mathematics, like set theory, introduces data structures whi
             ch are used in AI and pathfinding. They’re essential for FPS games like CS:GO who leverage
             graph theory to navigate complex environments. Decision trees also help create adaptive AI
             opponents, making each game experience unique.
            <br><br>
            While much of the back end aspects of game development relies on computer science, it’s 
            the integration of mathematics that truly brings games to life.

        <h2>Cryptographer</h2>
        <img src="images/cyber.png" id="cyber">
        <p>Cryptographers lay the foundations for rapid digitalization in the 21st century through their w
            ork with securing data and information. By using mathematical algorithms, they’re able to tran
            sform readable data (plaintext) into a coded form (ciphertext) that can only be decoded by the 
            intended recipient. 
            <br><br>
            In first year university, a core module is abstract algebra, specifically group theory, ring th
            eory, and fields, which is used to understand the algebraic structures used in algorithms like el
            liptic curve cryptography. In number theory, prime numbers are a key player for “scrambling” bit-
            wise data into information that are so computationally intensive to break by brute force, it wou

            private key pairs are built on these sets for their inherent lack of factorization patterns. Discr
            ete probability, modular arithmetic, and Diophantine equations are also taught to prepare students f
            or analyzing the security and efficiency of cryptography systems.
            <br><br>
            The proliferation of big data analytics, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) has led 
            to an era where data is the new currency. Where privacy because a vice and megacorporation stores 
            every second of your online footprint. In such a world, the potential for data breaches and cyber-attacks 
            escalates, making the work of cryptographers more crucial than ever.

        <img src="images/code.png" id="code">
        <p> In the realm of web development, both front-end and back-end developers engage with mathematics, 
            though in distinct ways. 
            <br><br> 
            Front-end developers often utilize basic arithmetic and algebra for layout design, ensuring 
            elements are proportionally scaled and spaced. Geometry plays a role in manipulating shapes 
            and layouts, particularly with CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive web designs. Trigonometry 
            can be applied in creating dynamic animations and transitions, enhancing visual appeal. Addit

        <h2>Reflection</h2>

        <p>
            For the past several months, I honed in on my literature review skills and realized that career 
            research takes a lot more time and effort than I expected. Some careers like an Astrobiologist 
            don’t have a definitive path in undergraduate university and subsequent years, they’re truly 
            interdisciplinary in the sense that specialists often major in two subjects (math and physics, 
            math and biology, math and astronomy etc…). Different institutions offer different courses and 
            I wanted to paint a full picture of what’s available for aspiring mathematicains, so I used a 
            combination of resources from CMU, the University of Toronto, and governmental organizations 
            like NASA for this report. 
            <br><br>
            I’ve always wanted to learn HTML, CSS, Node.js which are web developing tools that involve math, 
            so I took this opportunity to create my own site instead of using applications like WIX or Wordpress. 
            This turned out to be a really fascinating direction because, in the process of interacting with these 
            languages, I realized that web developers also use mathematics. A potential career path from my research 
            stemmed from me simply playing around with the scrollTrigger module from GSAP. 
            <br><br>
            I’m looking forward to diving deeper into Cryptography, Quantitative Analysts and Robotics Engineering. 
            As an aspiring pure maths major, it’s really exciting for me because these are real career paths I’ve 
            been considering after experiencing research at at undergraduate level during the Canadian Undergraduate 
            Mathematics Conference.
