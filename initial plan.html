            <h2>Machine Learning and Linear Algebra</h2>
            <p>
                Driving Question: How is mathematics used to drive the computation behind machine learning algorithms and what role do 
                they play in the field of Recommendation systems? 
                <br><br>
                Plan: My plan for this curriculum is to approach each module, whether that be mathematics or computer science based, with a three pronged attack: 
                    <br>
                   Stage 1: Research  
                    <br>
                    Stage 2: Review  
                    <br>
                    Stage 3: Execute  
                    <br><br>
                By tackling such a broad and deep field like Machine Learning this way, I can make sure that I
                get the most out of my learning by conducting in depth research, reviewing what I learned each week
                and practicing what I learned via projects. I've broken up all the topics I want to learn into the following modules,
                with expected dates of completion and resources I'll be using to support my learning. Of course, there'll be topics in the math curriculum
                will overlap with matrix units in the IDC4U course, but rest assured, things will heavily diverge later on. I'm also
                fiarly certain that I won't be able to learn everything, but I'll do as much as I can as well as prioritize depth over breath. Some resources might not 
                be available online without permission from the instructor (such as courses by Cornell University), if that 
                is the case, please feel free to reach out to me so I can share it via pdf or ppt:
